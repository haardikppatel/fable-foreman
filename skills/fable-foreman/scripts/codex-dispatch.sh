# fable-foreman — fixed-argv Codex launcher.
# Transport wrappers run ONLY this script, never a hand-composed codex command:
# argv is pinned here, so pipelines, substitutions, and nested codex invocations
# cannot ride in through the wrapper's shell (SKILL.md hard rail 1 carve-out).
# The wrapper-must-not-touch-codex rule itself is contractual and transcript-
# auditable, not machine-enforced — see codex-workers.md for the honest scope.
#
# Usage: codex-dispatch.sh <ticket-file> <model> <effort> <read-only|workspace-write> <artifact-jsonl> [workdir]
# Emits a transport envelope (exit code / duration / pid file / seat evidence) on
# stdout; the Codex event stream goes to <artifact-jsonl>, stderr to <artifact-jsonl>.stderr,
# the child PID to <artifact-jsonl>.pid (the "prove it stopped" handle).
